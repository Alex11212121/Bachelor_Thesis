# Bachelor_Thesis

This is the online repository for the bachelor thesis of Alexandre Kobrin at the University of St. Gallen, supervised by Prof. Roland Fuess. Both Appenix A and B are stored in their original format. 

### Appendix
Appendix A and B are both originally not in a pdf format. They were submitted as such to be uploadable in compas. The Jupyter Notebook and R Markdown files are included in the Appendix file. 

### Quick Acess
Files which are most likely to attract aditional attention have been listed under "Quick Acess". For HTML files it is advised to download them and opening them with Google Chrome (version: 115.0.5790.3). 

### Raw Codes
Given the large inital files, the actual operations on the data were not performed through Jupyter Notebook, which was only written for documentation purpouses. The original .py files are provided as a complement to the documentation.
