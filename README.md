# Bachelor_Thesis

Welcome to the online repository for the Bachelor thesis of Alexandre Kobrin, carried out at the University of St. Gallen and supervised by Prof. Roland Fuess. This repository contains supporting files, including original formats of Appendices A, Appendices B and interactive figures.
### Appendix
Appendix A and B are both originally not in a pdf format. They were submitted as such to be uploadable in compas. The Jupyter Notebook and R Markdown files are included in the Appendix file. 
### Quick Acess
Files that are most likely to attract additional attention have been listed under "Quick Acess". For HTML files, it is advised to download them and viewing them with Google Chrome (version 115.0.5790.0 or newer). 
### Raw Codes
Given the large initial files, the actual operations on the data were not performed through Jupyter Notebook, which was only written for documentation purposes. The original .py files are provided as a complement to the documentation.
